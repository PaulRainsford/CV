## Paul Rainsford

A Junior Full Stack Developer with a passion for the use of best coding practices, including writing clean, well tested and reusable code.<br>
Seeking a new challenge, a childhood interest in programming was reignited during lockdown and now, having recently completed an intensive 16 week software development bootcamp at, the highly selective, Makers Academy, I am looking forward to beginning an exciting new chapter of my life as a software developer.<br>
I have a strong desire to keep expanding my knowledge and improving my tech skills, a trait encouraged at Makers Academy, and look forward to working in an environment where this is encouraged and supported.

## Skills

#### Fast Learner

- When I first opened the doors of my own pub without any experience of running a business, I had to very quickly learn on the job all the skills involved in building a successful business which was achieved in a short space of time. During the coding bootcamp self-led learning is encouraged no more so than during the group projects, the penultimate of which, after a group decision not to go with the more common Rails route, I managed to learn Node.js and Express from scratch within a week to produce a Facebook clone. For the final project of the course, again in a week, I was able to learn React and MongoDB to add to my previous knowledge and produce a MERN stack app. As these technologies are not taught on the course, they were learnt via finding relevant docs and tutorials online.


#### Team Player

- Throughout my working life I have been able to work, and indeed thrive, as part of team. Whether on a construction site, in a busy pub or during a project on an intensive coding bootcamp, I have been fully committed to bringing all my knowledge and experience to the task in hand and collaborating with my colleagues to produce the best possible outcome.

### Excellent communicator

- The daily interaction with the public when working in and managing a pub requires and develops great communication skills. This proves a great asset when working on team projects to faciliate a smooth and harmonious workflow.

### Calm under Pressure

- Whether it was meeting targets on a construction site to keep the project on schedule, dealing with extremely busy periods or coping with staff shortages in a pub or learning brand new technologies in a matter of days to bring a group project to fruition, I have always thrived working under pressure and enjoyed it bringing the best out of me.

### Inquisitive

- I have always enjoyed learning and developing which is something I look forward to continuing in my development career.

### Committed

- Coming fron a totally non tech background and completing an entire 16 week bootcamp remotely has required considerable amounts of discipline, focus and commitment to the challenge.



## Education

#### Makers Academy (Jul '21 - Oct '21)

- Makers is an intensive and highly selective 16 week software development bootcamp with the aim of producing self-sufficient developers.
- Used pair programming regularly, which required good communication and teamwork in problem solving.
- Worked in an agile environment of extreme programming with the focus on producing high quality, clean code.
- Developed an understanding of OOP, TDD, BDD, MVC, DDD and SOLID principles.
- Independently and quickly learnt the new technologies needed to deliver the course group projects under strict time constraints.
- Worked with Ruby, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, Sinatra, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Jest and Cypress.
