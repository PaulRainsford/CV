## Paul Rainsford

A Junior Full Stack Developer with a passion for the use of best coding practices, including writing clean, well tested and reusable code.<br>
Seeking a new challenge, childhood interest in programming was reignited during lockdown and now, having recently completed an intensive 16 week software development bootcmp at, the highly selective, Makers Academy, I am looking forward to beginning an exciting new chapter of my life as software developer.<br>
I have a strong desire to keep expanding my knowledge and improving my tech skills, a trait encouraged at Maker Academy, and look forward to working in an environment where this is encouraged and supported.
